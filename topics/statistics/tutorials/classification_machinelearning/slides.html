zenodo_link: "https://zenodo.org/record/3738729"
questions:
  - What is classification and how we can use classification techniques?
objectives:
  - Learn classification background
  - Learn what a quantitative structure-analysis relationship (QSAR) model is and how it can be constructed in Galaxy
  - Learn to apply logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support verctor machines, random forests and bagging algorithms
  - Learn how visualizations can be used to analyze the classification results
key_points:
- Classification is a supervised approach in machine learning.
- For classification tasks, data is divided into training and test sets.
- Using classification, the samples are learned using the training set and predicted
  using the test set.
- For each classification algorithm, it parameters should be optimised based on the
  dataset.
- Machine learning algorithms can be applied to chemical datasets to predict important
  properties.

# Classification


- Class is a category
    - Represented as an integer (0, 1, 2, 3 ...)
    - Known as categorical variables
    - "Supervision" of classes
- Two class (binary) classification
    - Cancer or no cancer, spam or no spam
- Multi-class classification
    - Handwritten digit recognition
